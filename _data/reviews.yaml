    I hired Cesar to help me with my Ai assignment. Cesar first asked
    me about the comfort level of the subject. We then spent 10
    minutes on the problem statement & came up with the game plan. We
    executed 30% of the plan. Cesar guided me step by step while I did
    the coding. He gave me few tricks with the IDE. My understanding
    of the subject went from 50 % to 80%. I also feel every energized
    now after the session to do more on my own. Highly recommend
    Cesar!!!

    Cesar is an amazing teacher, he made difficult artificial
    intelligent algorithms and python concepts easy to understand for
    a beginners level perspective. He is patient and he explains every
    step of the process before moving to the next step, he moves at a
    rate that you are comfortable with. I am a visual learner so Cesar
    went above and beyond to draw out diagrams to help me digest the
    complex topics. I highly recommend Cesar!

    Cesar is the best data science tutor I've ever had. As a somewhat
    experienced programmer, I'm able to ask Cesar questions and he is
    able to tailor his responses accordingly. His passion for the
    subject is evident through the manner in which he teaches you new
    topics and ideas. If you need somebody to help you on a project or
    need general assistance, Cesar is the guy to go to.

    Cesar is good at teaching Python and has helped me work through
    each of the problems I've requested. He goes step by step and
    explains the process, and gives great feedback. It has been really
    beneficial for me in one of my classes as I've struggled with
    coding in Python.

    Cesar is friendly, knowledgeable, and VERY good at providing clear
    and thoughtful answers to very complex problems. Heâ€™s also very
    efficient as he spends time to full understand a problem rather
    than proceeding with a guess and check type of method. I would
    highly recommend his for any tutoring you need in python, ML or AI

    I had a few sessions with Cesar to learn about Machine
    Learning. Many people can be knowledgeable of a subject, but when
    it comes to teaching they find it hard to convey the information,
    especially when the person on the other end is still new to the
    subject. Cesar was able to check all the boxes and exceeded
    expectations. I recommend Cesar to be your next tutor.

    Cesar is an incredible teacher and approaches his students at
    their level of understanding with patience and grace. Expect to
    finish a lesson with more understanding and knowledge than when
    you began.

    Cesar was able to guide me through completion of my Python
    assignment and teach me the correct way to write quality code in
    Python. I learned how to implement solutions to the problems I was
    having while also learning even more about the style of writing
    Python. Cesar was willing and able to meet with me when I needed
    help at the last minute and I will be having more lessons with
    Cesar in the future!!

    Cesar did an amazing job explaining hard concepts in easy to
    understand ways. I look forward to working with him in the
    upcoming weeks. We went over the basics of API and will be working
    on a deeper understanding of API integration in the upcoming
    sessions.
